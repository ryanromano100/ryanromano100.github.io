<li><p>Step 1: Do not panic. Take a moment to calm yourself.</p></li>
<hr>
<li><p>Step 2: If you are in a dysfunctional family, you might be interested in safeguarding money stored in your bank account. If you have a "joint account" or are not sure, go to a bank and open a new account (you will need a state issued ID) and move your money because it's not considered "yours" alone.</p></li>
<hr>
<li><p>Step 3: Here are some items you might want to collect. Some of these can be useful for finding a job.</p></li>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>Social Security Card</li>
<li>Birth Certificate</li>
<li>Vaccination records</li>
<li>Passport</li>
<li>Cell Phone</li>
<li>Cell phone plan</li>
<li>Pen and paper</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<li><p>Step 4: Call family, or call friends, or call a homeless shelter from Google Maps, or call 211 (not every state) which is a social service number.</p></li>
